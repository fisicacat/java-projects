# My Java Projects
1. `InvertString.java` \
This programme invert the words in a string specified by user.

2. `solar-system-simulation` \
This Java programme simulates an N-body system evolving under a specified law of gravity. The programme uses Verlet Integration algorithm to update the positions and velocities of N bodies over time. The output can then be passed to VMD visualisation programme to create an animation (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/)
